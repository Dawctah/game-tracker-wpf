# Introduction 
Game Tracker:
A simple program designed to keep track of the games you want to play and when you want to play them

# How to Use
I built this tracker to be simple to use, but here is some info in case some of it isn't obvious:
Double click a game in the To-Play list to edit it's fields
Completing a game will only complete the first game in the list.
Removing a game removes whatever game in the To-Play list is selected
