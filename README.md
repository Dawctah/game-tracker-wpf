# Introduction 
Game Tracker:
A simple program designed to keep track of the games you want to play and when you want to play them

# Getting Started
If you don't want to edit code or don't know how to build, there is a release folder with the exe in it. Make sure you keep all of the files in the same folder as the exe or it will not work. You can right click, create shortcut and move the new shortcut to have the exe where ever you want on your PC, including desktop so you don't need to see all of the ugly files in use. Data is saved automatically on closing the application in your AppData > Roaming folder. This folder can easily be accessed by clicking a button in the application labelled "Open Backups Folder."

# How to Use
I built this tracker to be simple to use, but here is some info in case some of it isn't obvious:
Double click a game in the To-Play list to edit it's fields
Completing a game will only complete the first game in the list.
Removing a game removes whatever game in the To-Play list is selected
